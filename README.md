### In this project, you can enter two numbers and perform one of the four operations on them!


&nbsp;

## Examples
```
Input
Enter the first number: 5
Choose the operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter the second number: 7

Output
5 + 7 = 12
```
```
Input
Enter the first number: 2
Choose the operation (+, -, *, /): /
Enter the second number: 0

Output
You can't divide a number by 0!
```
```
Input
Enter the first number: 5
Choose the operation (+, -, *, /): $
Enter the second number: 3

Output:
Unrecognized operation. Only +, -, * or / are accepted
```

## Creation
#### To create this project, I used functions to organize the operations, a `while` loop to keep the program running until the user decides to exit, a `match case` statement to select the operation, and string manipulation. I also added input validation, such as preventing division by zero or invalid operations!
